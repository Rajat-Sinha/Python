#Threading
import threading
t = threading.Thread(group=None, target=None, name=None, args=(), kwargs={}, *, daemon=None)
target is the callable object to be invoked by the run() method
name is the thread name
args is the argument tuple for the target invocation
kwargs is a dictionary of keyword arguments for the target invocation
group should be None; reserved for future extension when a ThreadGroup class is implemented


t.dameon = True
A boolean value indicating whether this thread is a daemon thread (True) or not (False).
This must be set before start() is called, otherwise RuntimeError is raised.
Its initial value is inherited from the creating thread; the main thread is not a daemon thread and therefore all threads created in the main thread default to daemon = False


t.start() Start the threadâ€™s activity.
