import urllib we have to use function urllib.request
from urllib import request in this only request written can be used

#REQUEST

request.retrieve(url_name,new_file_name) for retrieving the exact value like image file also used to save exact source code in txt file

request.urlopen(url_name) for opening the url
request.urlopen(url_name).read() for reading the file also this doesnot get the source code as like as we see in chrome
request.urlopen(url_name).read().decode('utf-8') for converting into utf-8 means that grabbing the exact source code
request.urlopen(url_name).getheader('Content-Type') gives the values of text/html


from urllib.parse import urlparse
#This is used to break the url to get the valuse such as scheme,netloc,path,params,query,fragment
where url = https://github.com/Rajat-Sinha
and
(scheme='https', netloc='github.com', path='/Rajat-Sinha', params='', query='', fragment='')
 to get these above value we have to use urlparse(url)


#from urllib import parse
base_url = http://achiredo.com/,attribute = 'a' href='service.html'
attrs = [('href','service.html')]
parse.urljoin(self.base_url,value)#gives http://achiredo.com/service.html it joins the base_url with the value
